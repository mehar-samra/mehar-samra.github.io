This blog is meant to keep track of all of my software work, both from industry and from when I was in university. This blog was only recently made, but rest assured snapshots of my old work as well as updates from new projects will all be here soon!

I am currently a software engineer at Photron USA, where 'm developing a cutting-edge, node-based platform for AI, CV, and ML pipelines that leverage real-time sensing data. My expertise includes CUDA-based GPU acceleration, machine learning, and 3D rendering.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy spending time with family & friends, as well as staying active through fencing, surfing, and kickboxing.
