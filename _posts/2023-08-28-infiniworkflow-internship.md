## Photron Summer Internship 2023

This was the first time we were introduced to Infiniworkflow, an application that essentially removes the need for engineers to write their own code, as Infiniworkflow is an entirely node-based platform meant for real-time sensing data. Given Infiniworkflow's broad range of applicable fields -- including AI, Computer Vision, Image Processing, Image Correction, Tracking, Data Science, and IO Devices -- I was able to sink my teeth across many different fields throughout the course of the internship.

The fields I gained the most experience in were Image Processing, Computer Vision / Tracking, and AI Inference Models. Over the course of the summer we were able to add over 300 nodes/tools to Infiniworkflow, which put us in a great position for our end of internship presentation at Photron headquarters in Tokyo.

We performed several demos for various groups, either within Photron or within the Imagica Corporation at large. Despite only being in Tokyo for under a week, we were still able to ensure that the Infiniworkflow software would not just be a temporary project, but a meaningful pursuit for the company to take on.
