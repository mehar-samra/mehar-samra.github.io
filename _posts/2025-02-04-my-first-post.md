## SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 Presentation

We introduced Infiniworkflow to the world for the first time at Tokyo's SIGGRAPH Asia Conference in November of 2025.

After 3 days of demos to students, researchers, startup founders, and engineers and higher-ups from major companies (including Autodesk, Sony, and Mazda), we finally got the opportunity to speak on stage and present Infiniworkflow from top to bottom.

This is the short video we showed to students and higher-ups alike to introduce what Infiniworkflow can do: https://youtu.be/ZeLcDBEy8LE.
