## SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 Presentation

We introduced Infiniworkflow to the world for the first time at Tokyo's SIGGRAPH Asia Conference in November of 2025.

After 3 days of demos to students, researchers, startup founders, and engineers and higher-ups from major companies (including Autodesk, Sony, and Mazda), we finally got the opportunity to speak on stage and present Infiniworkflow from top to bottom.
